TODO:
- differentiation between different platforms to expand platform support --> implement logic in mk-tools
- lvm and iscsi for storage sharing instead of nfs
--> master and slave lvm prepare logic
- stabilize docker functionality after powerloss on any node
- replace rootfs with squashfs on master --> not working if slaves uses the same initramfs as tftp boot
